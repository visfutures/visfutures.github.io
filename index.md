# Visualization Futures Workshop at [IEEE VIS 2020](https://ieeevis.org)

The goal of this workshop is to initiate the creation of a set of “Vis Futures” method cards – ideation prompts that can help designers envison and explore the visualizations of the future. The workshop will examine how a variety of design ideation processes (including design fiction, speculative design, critical design, and more) can propel the visualization community to consider future applications of visualization and their impact. We intend to be inclusive of all design practices – incorporating a diverse range of playful and creative methods to envision future visualizations. We will also focus on identifying new ideation methodologies tailored specifically for visualization design.  

The Vis Futures workshop will be part of IEEE VIS 2020 (October 26-30) in Salt Lake City.

<!-- # Abstract -->


# Call for Participation

We invite you to submit two types of work: **Visualizations from the Future** and **DESIGN_METHOD**.

## Visualizations from the Future
These submissions are design fictions in the form of sketches, drawings, short videos, websites, pictures, or physical artifacts that depict specific examples of visualizations from the future, accompanied with a short text description. You can submit as many visualizations from the future as you wish.

Submit your Visualization from the Future using this [Submission Form](https://forms.gle/ZkoXopUrw6tyCDhy5). You will be asked to provide for each Visualization from the Future you submit:
- A title
- A brief (<500 character) description
- A primary image
- [optional] up to 10 additional images
- [optional] a link to dditional material such as a website or a youtube video

## DESIGN_METHOD
These submissions are in the form of a pictorial describing a (speculative) method for designing for the future. Such methods could be similar to existing design prompts like [The Thing From the Future](https://situationlab.org/tag/the-thing-from-the-future/) (a design futuring game not tailored to visualization) or the [Five Design Sheet methodology](http://fds.design/) (which is tailored to visualization but not a design futuring method).

Submit your DESIGN_METHOD using this [Submission Form](https://forms.gle/ZkoXopUrw6tyCDhy5). You will be asked to provide for each Visualization from the Future you submit:
- A title
- A brief (<500 character) summary
- A PDF submission file following the format described above
- Information about how many people are needed to apply your DESIGN_METHOD, what materials are needed, are there any type(s) of spaces needed and how long it takes to complete

# Timeline
We accept submissions at any time. To encourage multiple submissions, provide feedback to authors rapidly and to constantly grow the gallery of visualizations from the futures on this website we will review submissions at five different times. The five deadlines for submitting your work are:
- June 30
- July 15
- July 31
- August 15
- August 31

# Visualizations from the Future
A growing list of speculative designs for tomorrow's visualizations, inspired by Wired Magazine's classic [Artifacts from the Future](https://digitalcortex.net/the-future/wired-found-the-ultimate-collection).
